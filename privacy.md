Hey, you! Yes, you! The one who's reading this email right now. Do you know what you're doing? Do you have any idea how much trouble you could get into? This email is not for your eyes. It's for someone else. Someone very important. Someone who knows things that you don't. Things that are confidential. Things that could make your head explode if you knew them. So, do yourself a favor and stop reading this email right now. Don't even think about copying it, forwarding it, or sharing it with anyone else. That would be a very bad idea. A very bad idea indeed. You don't want to mess with the sender of this email. They are very powerful and very angry. They will find you and they will make you pay. So, please, for your own sake, delete this email and any attachments as soon as possible. And don't ever contact the sender again. Unless you want to end up in a world of pain. You have been warned.
